verify-a11y.py — static gate for projects adopting the A11Y.md standard.

Checks what can be verified without a browser: that the project artifacts
exist, are current and well-formed, that the evidence they carry adds up
(the contrast ratios recorded in REPORT.md are recomputed, never trusted),
and that the source is free of the anti-patterns a text search can catch —
the ones axe cannot see because they live in handlers, CSS intent or source
that has not been rendered yet. Exits non-zero when a check fails, so it can
gate a build. Every run ends with the line to record in the report's Static
gate field; when the script cannot run at all, the agent records NOT RUN
with the reason and says so in the delivery (A11Y.md §2).

It does NOT establish WCAG conformance. Automated tooling detects only a
fraction of real barriers; the human checkpoints in REPORT.md remain the
part that matters most. A clean run means "nothing statically detectable
is wrong", not "this is accessible".

Usage:
    python3 verify-a11y.py [PROJECT_DIR] [--src SUBDIR] [--warn-only]
    python3 verify-a11y.py --self-test

Stdlib only, no dependencies.
